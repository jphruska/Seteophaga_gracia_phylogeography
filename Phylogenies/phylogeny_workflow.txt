## Generate thousands of "genes" from across the genome (non-overlapping 50 kbp windows) and estimated RAxML gene trees and ASTRAL species tree. Summarize best supported phylogenies using sumtrees.py. 


Step 1. 

## Filter concatenated VCF files. Make sure to remove sex chromosome after filtering and include Setophaga nigrescens individual. Also filter out low depth of coverage individuals. 



When filtering, be sure to keep invariant and variant sites. 

Step 2. 

## Take filtered VCF files and generate FASTA files with custom R script.
