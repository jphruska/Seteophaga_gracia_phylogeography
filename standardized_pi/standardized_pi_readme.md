# Standardized pi (pi/max(dxy)) workflow (Figure S12, S13, S14). 

1. Run standardized_pi.R, which will read in windowed pi and dxy estimates (see sections pi and dxy for more information), calculate standardized pi for each population (Southwest_USA, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Chiapas, El Salvador + Honduras, and Nicaragua), plot the correlations between these estimates for each population comparison, and generate genomic landscapes across autosomes for each population. The window_dxy.txt file is not provided here due to limitations of size, but please do reach out for a copy at jackphruska@gmail.com
