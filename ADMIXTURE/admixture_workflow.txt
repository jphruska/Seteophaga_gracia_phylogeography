## Run ADMIXTURE to evaluate population structure across range ## 

Dataset 1 (remove low coverage samples but keep Belizean samples) 

Step 1. Filter VCFs using VCFtools (01_dataset1_admixture_filtering.sh). Remove filtered sex chromosome (CM027535.1) VCF. Remove Setophaga nigrescens and remove low coverage individuals ( > 6x ; but keep Belize samples). Thin to 10 kb. 

Step 2. Concatenate filtered VCFs into one VCF and run ADMIXTURE with the resulting VCF as input. Run K of 1 - 10, use cross validation error to obtain 'best' K and repeat this several times to evaluate reliability of results. 

Step 3. Repeat above steps, this time thinning to 50 kb instead (01_dataset1a_admixture_filtering.sh). 

Dataset 2 (remove all low coverage samples, including Belizean samples). 

Step 1. Filter VCFs using VCFtools (XX filtering file here). Remove filtered sex chromosome (CM027535.1) VCF. Remove Setophaga nigrescens and all low coverage ( > 6 x) samples (including Belizean samples). Thin to 10 kb. 

Step 2. Concatenate filtered VCFs into one VCF and run ADMIXTURE on that. Run K of 1 - 10, use cross validation error to obtain 'best' K and repeat this several times to evaluate reliability of results. 

Step 3. Repeat above steps, this time thinning to 50 kb instead.
