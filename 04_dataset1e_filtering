# Filtering for additional admixture analysis, with larger SNP dataset (115,343 SNPs). Removed all MSB individuals and UWBM 114089 due to low sequencing depth ( > 4.5 coverage).  

# In vcf directory, made directory called dataset1e. 

# Filtered all vcfs in this directory using vcftools commmands in 01_dataset1e_filtering.sh. These data are thinned every 1 kb. 

# Moved all filtered vcfs to datset1e directory. 

# Carried out the following commands to create on concatenated vcf (with headers).
