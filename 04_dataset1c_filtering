# Filtering for preliminary admixture analyses. Removed all MSB individuals and UWBM 114089 due low sequencing depth ( > 4.5 coverage). 

# In vcf directory, made directory called dataset1c. 

# Filtered all vcfs in this directory using vcftools commmands in 01_dataset1c_filtering.sh. These data are thinned every 10 kb. 

# Moved all filtered vcfs to datset1c directory. 

# Carried out the following commands to create on concatenated vcf (with headers). 

grep "#" CM027508.1__b.g.vcf.dataset1c.vcf.recode.vcf >> setophaga_1c.vcf
