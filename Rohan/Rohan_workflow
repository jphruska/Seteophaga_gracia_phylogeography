## Run ROHan to get estimates of run of homozygosity per individual.

## This preliminary run will focus on getting estimates excluding those with low sequencing depth > 10 x, including the Belizean samples, which are derived from skin samples. 



Step 1. Filter VCFs using vcftools (01_dataset6_filtering.sh). Only biallelic sites are retained, with no missing data. These filtered VCFs will be used to estimate TS:TV ratio (Transition/Transversion) ratio, which ROHan requires as input. After filtering, sex chromosome (CM027535.1) will be removed, and the resulting VCFs will be concatenated into one file. Be sure to test this with different bin sizes, to ensure that TS:TV ratio is not sensitive to bin size. 

# removing sex chromosome

rm CM027535.1.g.vcf.dataset6.vcf.recode.vcf

# concatenating VCF files into one. 

grep "#" CM027513.1.g.vcf.dataset6.vcf.recode.vcf >> setophaga_6.vcf

for i in `ls *.recode.vcf` ; do grep -v "#" $i >> setophaga_6.vcf ; done

# use VCFTools to estimate TS:TV ratio. Start with a bin size of 1000 bp. Then do a bin size of 10000 bp. 

Step 2. Use ROHan (on BAM files) to evaluate runs of homozygosity.
